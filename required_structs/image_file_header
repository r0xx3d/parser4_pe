// Machine indicated the type of CPU Architecture the executable is targeting
// Possible values of machine:
// 0x8864 (AMD64)
// 0x14C (i386)

// NumberOfSections holds the number of sections headers aka size of section table

// TimeDateStamp is a unix timestamp that indicates when a file was created

// PointerToSymbolTable and NumberOfSymbols hold the offset to COFF symbol
// table and number of entries in that symbol table
// They get set to 0 which means no COFF symbol table is present

// SizeOfOptionalHeader (literally the name lol)

// Characteristics is a flag that indicates the attributes of the file
// i.e. the file is an executable, the file is a system file not user program
